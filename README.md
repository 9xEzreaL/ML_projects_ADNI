ðŸ“– Developed as final project work for the Machine Learning Course. 


Data from Kaggle and ADNI dataset, we used Kaggle dataset as training and validation, ADNI dataset as tesing.

    Kaggle dataset download : https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers

    ADNI dataset download : http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used here to classify brain MRIs into normal, mild and moderate Alzheimer classes. 

The data in total consists of 4160 images in Kaggle dataset, 40 images in ADNI dataset.

    â€¢ Non-demented: 3200 images                            â€¢ Normal-Control: 14 cases
    â€¢ Mild-demented: 896 images                            â€¢ Mild-Cognitive-Impairment: 18 cases
    â€¢ Moderate-demented: 64 images                         â€¢ Alzheimer's-Disease: 8 cases

ðŸ‘‘ Achieve 97% accuracy in training, 97% accuracy in validation!
